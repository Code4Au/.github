# CODE4's Development Philosophy;

### Stop Guessing. Start Measuring.
Too often, we get stuck trying to make the right decision and can't make the jump, or we have an ocean of options & opportunity anxiety. It’s always good to think before you act, but you can’t measure success until you have something to measure. Change is good. Being able to measure its effectiveness is better. Being able to react and do both quickly is best.

### Little by Little, Byte by Byte
Iterative enhancement is a well know refinement approach in software development, and we know that regardless of how good something is right now, with time comes new data and, with it, the opportunity to improve. Work with us to see these benefits.

### Build Better, Build Faster
Rather than spending weeks in design and pre-production perfecting the end deliverable, often a better approach is to release components as soon as they meet their core requirement. Speed does not have to mean risk if you have the right technology and processes. Code4 runs a similar philosophy so you too can adapt rapidly.
